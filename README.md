# Notakto
Notakto is a variant of tic-tac-toe which can be played across one or several boards. Both players use the same piece, and "X", with the goal of forcing the opponent to make a three-in-a-row of Xs. The game is traditional played on a 3x3 board, however any NxM board is possible where N,M >= 3.
